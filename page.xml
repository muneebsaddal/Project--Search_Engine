'''April''' is the 4th [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It is one of four months to have 30 [[day]]s.

April always begins on the same day of week as [[July]], and additionally, [[January]] in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as [[December]].

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==
[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year.

April begins on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year and on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year, as each others' last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.

In [[common year|common years]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s, [[May]] of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as [[July]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[February]] and [[October]] of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[June]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[March]] and June of the following year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

'''August''' (Aug.) is the 8th [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

August doesn't begin on the same day of the week as any other month in [[Common year|common years]], but begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[Leap year|leap years]].  August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]].

No other month in [[common year|common years]] begins on the same day of the week as August, but August begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August ends on the same day of the week as [[November]] every year, as each others' last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.

In common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[June]] of the previous year. In common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as March and June of the previous year, and in leap years, [[September]] of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, August starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[October]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[February]] and October of the following year.

'''Art''' is a creative activity by people.  These people are called [[artist]]s.  They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Artists express themselves by their art. Some people find art relaxing. Many people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. 

Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.
* Plastic arts
** Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]]
** Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]
* Performing arts
** Performing art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]])
** Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
* Practical arts
** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
** The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])

== What &quot;art&quot; means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]].  An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired.

The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design. 

Art may express [[emotion]].  Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an [[audience]].  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] era.

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her &quot;[[talent]]&quot; into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist.

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) Cognitive function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) Aesthetic function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) Prognostic function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic function

:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

: ''This page is about the first [[letter]] in the [[alphabet]].''
: ''For the indefinite article, see [[Article (grammar)]].''
: ''For other uses of A, see [[A (disambiguation)]]''

{{A-Z}}
[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, '''a''', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long '''a''' (ā) is said as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]]. A capital a is written &quot;A&quot;. Use a capital a at the start of a sentence if trying to communicate.

==Where it came from==
The earliest letter 'A' has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet's [[aleph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; This symbol came from a simple picture of an [[ox]] head. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;&quot;
! Egyptian
! Phoenician &lt;br&gt;''[[aleph]]''
! Greek &lt;br&gt;''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''
! Etruscan &lt;br&gt;A
! Roman/Cyrillic &lt;br&gt;A
|- style=&quot;background-color:white; text-align:center;&quot;
|[[File:EgyptianA-01.svg|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]
|[[File:PhoenicianA-01.svg|Phoenician aleph]]
|[[File:Alpha uc lc.svg|65px|Greek alpha]]
|[[File:EtruscanA.svg|Etruscan A]]
|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

==Using the letter==
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word ''pad''. Other sounds of this letter are in the words ''father'', which developed into another sound, such as in the word ''ace''.

==Use in mathematics==
In algebra, the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.

'''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]].  It has [[mass]] and [[weight]], because it is [[matter]].  The weight of air creates [[atmosphere pressure|atmospheric  pressure]].  There is no air in [[outer space]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 0.9% [[argon]], 0.04% [[carbon dioxide]], and very small amounts of other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013). Earth’s Oxygen: a mystery easy to take for granted. New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an average of about 1% water vapour.

Animals live by [[aerobic respiration]] and need to breathe the oxygen in the air. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s put oxygen into the [[blood]], and send back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off the oxygen that we breathe.   

[[Wind]] is moving air. This causes [[weather]]. 

Air [[air pollution|can be polluted]] by some gases (such as [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and ash. This [[air pollution]] causes various problems including [[acid rain]] and [[global warming]].

Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]]. [[Pneumatics]] use [[air pressure]] to move things.

[[File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg|thumbnail|This is the symbol of a Wikipedia administrator. It shows the site's logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]]
'''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.

''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''

=== Administrative tools ===
==== Delete ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].

=====Revision Delete=====
Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].

==== Protect ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] (.js or .css) files.
* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.

==== Block ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.
* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different to bans.

==== Rollback ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:

:'''m''' ''Reverted edits by '''User A''' ('''talk''') to last version by '''User B'''

To use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].
* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].

==== Import pages ====
They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.

==== View unwatched pages ====
They can see which pages are not on someone's watchlist.

==== Manage userrights ====
They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, flooder, the uploader right, and the patroller right for all accounts.

== Bureaucrat ==
{{shortcut|WP:CRAT|WP:BUR}}
A '''bureaucrat''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also &quot;flag&quot; and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. These requests were handled on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]]. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for [[:m:SUL finalization|SUL finalization]]. Now, these requests should be made at [[:m:SRUC|Meta-Wiki]] or on this [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|special page]] where stewards and global renamers will handle them.

== CheckUser ==
A select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].

== Oversighter ==
Certain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the [[United States]] of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called &quot;historic communities&quot;: Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the sole official language in every autonomous community but six, where Spanish is co-official with other languages, as follows:
* [[Catalonia]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]]
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]]: [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
* [[Galicia]]: [[Galician language|Galician]]
* [[:en:Basque_Country|Basque Country]]: [[Basque language|Basque]]
* [[Navarre]]: [[basque language|Basque]] (only in the north and near the border with the Basque County)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[:en:Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander, Spain|Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and León]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called &quot;autonomous cities&quot; and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumb|right|A rebuild of a machine made by Alan Turing]]

'''Alan Mathison Turing''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[FRS]] ([[London]], 23 June 1912 – [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], 7 June 1954) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Young Life and Family ==
Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father was part of a family of [[Merchant|merchants]] from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the [[daughter]] of an [[engineer]].

=== Education ===
Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was six years old.

== Career ==
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]]. 

Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called &quot;[[Intelligence|intelligent]]&quot;. A computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, Stevan 2008.  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Turing worked to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). Using [[cryptanalysis]], he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he solved other German codes.

From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was &quot;the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.

== Private life ==
Turing was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, [[homosexual]] acts were illegal. Turing was [[conviction|convicted]]. He had to choose between going to [[jail]] and taking [[hormone]]s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his punishment, he became [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. He also grew [[breast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author=Andrew Hodges | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, a [[private member's bill]] was put before the [[House of Lords]] to grant Turing a statutory [[pardon]].&lt;ref name=Guardian-Pardon&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary bill launched for Alan Turing pardon|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/25/alan-turing-private-members-bill-lord-sharkey|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the government supported it.&lt;ref name=turingguardian19july2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/19/enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-posthumous-pardon|title=Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing to be given posthumous pardon|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 July 2013|author=Nicholas Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal pardon was granted on 24&lt;!-- Mercy is effective from 24 December although it was announced on the night of 23rd --&gt; December 2013.&lt;ref name=turingindependent24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency' – 61 years after he poisoned himself|publisher=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|Author=Oliver Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turingpardoncryptome24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf|title=(Archived copy of) Royal Pardon for Alan Turing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In 1954, after suffering for two years, Turing died from [[cyanide]] poisoning. The cyanide came from either an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8&lt;/ref&gt;It is also suspected that he committed suicide. 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31&amp;nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 01&amp;nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition received thousands of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;The petition was only open to UK citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition. He called Turing's treatment &quot;appalling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PM's apology to codebreaker Alan Turing: we were inhumane | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/11/pm-apology-to-alan-turing | publisher=The Guardian| date = 11 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from [[France]] or [[Germany]] (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the [[United States|USA]] is the &quot;Cajun&quot; style. 

Other sorts are &quot;French andouille&quot; and &quot;German andouille&quot;; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

'''Farming''' is growing [[crop]]s or keeping animals by people for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].

Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Tudge argues &quot;from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'&quot;. Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p3. ISBN 0-297-84258-7&lt;/ref&gt; The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and became [[settler]]s in what became [[cities]].

Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. University College London Press. ISBN 1-56098-675-1&lt;/ref&gt; The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.

== Kinds of farming ==
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, animal hides ([[skin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or [[fur]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]]s , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]]).

Many people still live by [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm.  They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals.  The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low.  This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s.  Where yields are low, [[deforestation]] can provide new land to grow more food.  This provides more [[nutrition]] for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding [[environment]] over many years.

In rich countries, farms are often fewer and larger.  During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests.  Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land.  There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. 

This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.

=== Agriculture techniques ===
* [[Fertilizer]]s
* [[Crop rotation]]
* [[Weed]] removal
* [[Breeding]]
* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]
* [[Ranching]]
* [[Plantation]]

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value.  They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and drought, and are easier to harvest.  Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.

New plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide.

== Food ==
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.
* Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.
* Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. 
* Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. 
* Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.
* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.
* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.

== Problems in agriculture ==
There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.
These include:
* [[Erosion]]
* [[Diseases]]
* [[Pests]]
* [[Weed]]s
* [[Drought]]
* [[Rainfall]]

== Crops ==
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

*[[Maize]] 624 millions of metric tons
*[[Wheat]] 570 millions of metric tons
*[[Rice]] 381.1 millions of metric tons
*[[Cotton]] 96.5 millions of metric tons

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arithmetic''' is a name for working with [[number]]s. It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

Harder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].

Most people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. 

A [[calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic. [[Computer]]s can do it more quickly, which is one reason [[Global Positioning System]] receivers have a small computer inside. 

== Examples of arithmetic ==

* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)

* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)

* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)

* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)

[[Image:Addition.gif|thumb|220px|Addition ]]

'''Addition''' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.

== Arithmetic ==

In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is &quot;+&quot;. The name for the sign &quot;+&quot; is &quot;plus&quot;.  
Another name for the total is the [[sum]].

=== Counting examples ===
For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: &quot;o&quot;. One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  

====Adding====

Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:

:{{math|5 + 3}}

There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that:

:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}

In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.

'''Vertical Addition'''

The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).  First the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, the 3 is written below and the 1 ten is carried to the tens column. Next in the tens column the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, the 5 is written below and the 1 hundred is carried to the hundreds column. Finally in the hundreds column 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, the 2 is written below and the 1 thousand is carried to the thousand column. Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three.

===A measurement example===
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300 meters  east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120 meters east of Bob's house:

:Tom's house&lt;------------300 meters--------------&gt;Bob's house&lt;-----120 meters-----&gt;Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.
:{{math|{{aao|300|120|+}}}}

== Addition as increase ==
Addition can also mean to make bigger.

=== Example of addition as increase ===
* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.

* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is a [[food additive]] or addition to the food.

'''Australia''', officially called the '''Commonwealth of Australia''', is a [[country]] and [[sovereign state]] in the [[southern hemisphere]], located on its own [[continent]] between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. Its [[capital city]] is [[Canberra]], and its largest city is [[Sydney]].

Australia is the [[List of countries by area|sixth biggest country in the world]] by land area, and is part of the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[Australasia]]n regions. Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and other islands on the Australian [[tectonic plate]] are together called [[Australasia]], which is one of the world's great [[ecozone]]s. When other Pacific islands are included with Australasia, it is called [[Oceania]].

23{{ndash}}24 million people live in Australia, and about 80% of them live on the east coast. The country is divided up into six [[States of Australia|states]], and more than half of Australia's [[population]] lives in and around the cities of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]].

Australia is known for its [[mining]], its production of [[wool]], and as the world's largest producer of [[bauxite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mams.rmit.edu.au/0wzm6liriybr1.PDF|title=Alcola World Alumina Australia|publisher=MAMS.RMIT.edu.au|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle.

== Geography ==

[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]

Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Kate | year=2008 | title=National Geographic Australia | publisher=Horupu | location=Tokyo | page=pp.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in 1901. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

=== Regions and cities ===
{{Other pages|List of Cities in Australia}}
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cummins | first=Brian R. | year=1990 | title=Australia | publisher= the Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | pages= 16-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).

In 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 23.13 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Oceania South Pole | author= Tanabe Yu | year= 1997 | publisher= Asakura Bookstore | location= Shinjyuku ward | page= 3179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]

The [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Hesp, Patrick A. ''et al'' 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. ''Australian Archaeology'', No 49 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html |title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Australia colonized earlier than previously thought? |first= |last= |work=stonepages.com |year=2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The history of Australia |author=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004|publisher=Yuhikaku ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

=== Terra Australis ===
In the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find &quot;[[Terra Australis]]&quot; (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw &quot;New South Wales&quot;. At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

=== Settlement ===
[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was &quot;the finest harbor in the world!&quot; There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.

Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

=== Exploration ===
[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17-year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&amp;nbsp;miles from Sydney.

Some people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The [[Henty Brothers|Henty brothers]] had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

===Self government===

The gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.

The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===

Until 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the [[British Empire]], and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.

In Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.

Australia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.

In 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.

== Politics ==
[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]

Australia is made up of six [[state]]s and three mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]]. Each state and territory has its own [[Parliament]] and makes its own local [[law]]s. The [[Parliament of Australia]] sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or [[Federation]].

The [[Federation|Federal]] government is led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is [[Malcolm Turnbull]].

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] represents the Queen of Australia, who is also the Queen of Great Britain, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently [[His Excellency]] [[Peter Cosgrove|Sir Peter Cosgrove]], is chosen by the Prime Minister.

== Culture ==
[[File:Sydney Opera House Night.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The [[Sydney Opera House]] was officially opened in 1973.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Australia was [[Colonisation|colonised]] by people from [[Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New History of Australia |authors=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004 |publisher=ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=pp. 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but today people from all over the world live there. English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion, though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are encouraged to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians.

Famous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument. [[File:didgeridoo.jpg|thumb|[[didgeridoo]]]]

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (''Dame Edna Everage''), [[Steve Irwin]] (''The Crocodile Hunter'') and [[The Wiggles]]. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as [[Bogan Hunters]] and [[Kath &amp; Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/our-fascination-with-bogans-will-be-televised-25262 |title=&quot;Our fascination with &quot;Bogans&quot; will be televised&quot; |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |last=Smith |first=Michelle |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]''.

[[Australian cinema|Australian movies]] have a very long history. The world's first feature movie was the Australian movie ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang Video Overview The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', directed by [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]], had [[Errol Flynn]] as the main actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/ Video Overview In the Wake of the Bounty (1933) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/ Video Overview Kokoda Front Line! (1942) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with movies like ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', [[Gallipoli (1981 movie)|''Gallipoli'']] (with [[Mel Gibson]]), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 movie)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' and ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html &quot;Fair Dinkum Fillums&quot;: the Crocodile Dundee Phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] became global stars during the 1990s and ''[[Australia (2008 movie)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]] made a lot of money in 2008.

Australia is also a popular destination for business conferences and research, with Sydney named as one of the top 20 meeting destinations in the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesseventssydney.com.au/conferences/meet-in-sydney/|title=Meet in Sydney|newspaper=Business Events Sydney|access-date=2017-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sport ===
[[File:DonaldBradman.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Don Bradman]].]]

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndca.asn.au/other-information/about-australia/|title=About Australia|publisher=NDCA|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In international sports, Australia has very strong teams in [[cricket]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]], [[rowing]] and [[swimming]]. Local popular sports include [[Australian Rules Football]], horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 [[Commonwealth Games]] and are to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the [[Australian Open]], one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]]. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.

The main sporting leagues for males are the [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]] and [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|NBL]].
For women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] and [[WNBL]].

Famous Australian [[sports]] players include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].

=== Art festivals ===

Just 60 years ago, Australia had only one big art festival. Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals, and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/arts_festivals.html | title=Art festivals | author=Australian government | accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife ==
Australia is home to many animals that can be found nowhere else on Earth, which include: the [[koala]], the [[kangaroo]], the [[wombat]], the [[numbat]], the [[emu]], among many others. Most of the [[Marsupial|marsupials]] in the world are found only on the continent.[[File:Numbat.jpg|thumb|[[Numbat]]]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''American English''' or '''United States English''' is the [[dialect]] of [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States|United States of America]]. It is different in some ways from other types of English, such as [[British English]]. Many types of American English came from local dialects in England.

Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another sort of English is spoken. This may be because people hear and read American English through the [[mass media|media]], for example [[CNN]] television, and the [[Internet]], where the most common form of English is American English.

Because people all over the world use American English as well as other types of English, the English language gets new words. Because of this, English has been changing for hundreds of years. For example, the English language spoken in [[India]], which has more than one billion people, keeps adding more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from any of the 200+ Indian languages.

Sometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America. These people often keep using American English in everyday life.

The meaning of many words are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]] all came from [[Latin]].

== Spelling ==
There are many words that sound the same in both American English and British English, but are spelled differently.  For example:

*Words originally from French that end in &quot;-our&quot; in British English (behaviour, colour, honour, neighbour, etc.) end in &quot;-or&quot; in American English (behavior, color, honor, neighbor). 
&lt;br/&gt;Words of that come from French that end in -re in British English (metre, centre) end in -er in American English. In these cases [[Canadian]] usage is to keep the British (and French) spelling.
*Verbs that end in -ise in British English (criticise, realise) end in -ize in American English (criticize, organize, realize). However, the -ize ending is optional in British English, and is shown as an option in British dictionaries.
*One of the changes introduced by Noah Webster is the change of the double &quot;l&quot; from words like &quot;travelled&quot; to &quot;traveled&quot;. 

Books show that many of these differences come from the writings of English-lover [[Noah Webster]], who made the American dictionary following the [[American War of Independence]].

Some more differences in American English:
* aluminium is spelled &quot;aluminum&quot;
* doughnut is sometimes spelled &quot;donut&quot;
* draught is spelled &quot;draft&quot;
* gaol (not common) is spelled &quot;jail&quot;
* plough is spelled &quot;plow&quot;

== Vocabulary ==
There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English, e.g.:
* aeroplane is called &quot;airplane&quot;
* ladybird is called &quot;ladybug&quot;
* lift is called &quot;elevator&quot;
* toilet is called &quot;bathroom&quot;, &quot;restroom&quot; or &quot;comfort station&quot;
* lorry is called &quot;truck&quot;
* nappies are called &quot;diapers&quot;
* petrol is called &quot;gas&quot; (or &quot;gasoline&quot;)
* the boot of a car is called a &quot;trunk&quot;
* a dummy is called a &quot;pacifier&quot;
* trousers are called &quot;pants&quot;
* underground is called &quot;subway&quot;
* football is called &quot;soccer&quot;
* braces are &quot;suspenders&quot; (&quot;suspenders&quot; in British-English are a type of clothing worn around the lower leg by males to stop socks/sox from sagging, and around the upper leg by women wearing stockings)

== Regional accents ==
* '''R-dropping''' is a thing that occurs for English speakers in certain places where &quot;r&quot; sound is not pronounced after a [[vowel]]. For [[example]] as in the words &quot;car&quot; and &quot;card&quot; sounding like &quot;cah&quot; and &quot;cahd&quot;. This occurs in the Boston area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Delta Pride Catfish farm harvest.jpg|thumb|The Delta Pride Catfish farms.]]
'''Aquaculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]], and other seafood.  Aquaculture supplies fish, such as [[catfish]], [[salmon]], and [[trout]]. Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in [[China]] and aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. 

Aquaculture is quite a new activity in [[Canada]] as it only began in [[1879]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''abbreviation''' is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The [[English language]] occasionally uses the [[apostrophe]] mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use [[Period (punctuation)|periods]], especially the ones that come from the [[Latin]] language. Common Latin abbreviations include '''i.e.''' [id est] ''that is'', '''e.g.''' [exempli gratia] ''for example'', and '''et al.''' [et alia] ''and others''.

Some new abbreviations have been created by [[scientist]]s, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the [[Internet]].

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are [[acronym]]s.

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word &quot;[[radar]]&quot; is an [[acronym]] for &quot;Radio Detection and Ranging&quot;. The name of the large computer company [[IBM]] comes from the words &quot;International Business Machines&quot;. The name of the part of the [[United States]] government that sends [[rocket]]s into [[outer space]] is NASA, from the words &quot;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&quot;. When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write &quot;LOL&quot; to mean &quot;Laughing Out Loud&quot;. People sometimes write &quot;ASAP&quot; for &quot;As Soon As Possible&quot;.

In many mythologies and [[religion]]s, an '''angel''' is a good [[spirit]]. The word angel comes from the Greek word ''angelos'' which means &quot;messenger&quot;. Angels appear frequently in the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], [[Qur'an]] and [[Aqdas]].

==In the Bible==
Angels are powerful, smart spirits that obey God's commands and praise him with singing and they have [[male]] ([[masculine]])[[gender]], but without any sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:53}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes appear to [[human]]s in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can deliver messages to people in person or in [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels that are named in the [[Bible]] are [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (called a &quot;chief prince&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Gabriel]] (known for telling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] that she would be the mother of [[Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:26-38}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Raphael (in the [[Apocrypha]]l [[Book of Tobit]]).&lt;ref name=ABF&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=1603207783|pages=4-7, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ethiopia]]n [[Book of Enoch]] also lists four Archangels which watch over the four quadrants of heaven; Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible.

===Types===
*'''Cherubim''' (plural of cherub) are described as &quot;winged creatures&quot; which have four wings&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherubim guard the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] with a [[sword]] of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. Genesis 3:24 is found in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God.&lt;ref&gt;The IVP New Bible Commentary pp734 states: ' the exact significance of the cherub is unclear'&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezekiel 28:13-14
13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

It describes the sound of their wings, &quot;like the roar of rushing waters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings .

Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have &quot;straight feet&quot; and four wings and four faces.

Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16

Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be &quot;a wheel in the midst of a wheel&quot; and that the color of the wheels was the color of &quot;Amber&quot; Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there.

*'''Seraphim''' (plural of seraph, which means &quot;burning&quot;)they also are depicted having wings, six of them. They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the [[temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Archangels''' like Gabriel ([[Gospel of Luke]] 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered [[saint]]s in the [[Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=ABF/&gt; However, in the King James Version of the Bible; they are another type of angel. In the [[Book of Revelation]] the Angel Michael casts the 'great dragon' [[Satan]] out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels, just before the Great Judgement of angels and man. (Revelation 12)
*The [[Leviathan]] in [[Book of Job]] 41:19-21 has flame that goes:  'out of his mouth' like a [[dragon]].  Isaiah 30:6 also talks of a 'fiery flying serpent'. Compare Revelation 20:2: , where an angel: 'laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the [[Devil]], and Satan, and bound him a thousand years'.

==In art==
They are often shown in art as having wings and a [[halo]]. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness.

The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings.

The cherubim statue or [[bronze]] casting of cherubim in the Temple of [[Solomon]] depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making.

The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork, and was attempted by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]].

==Angelology==
The study of Angels is called Angelology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theology.edu/theology/angel.htm Angelology]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ad hominem''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a type of [[argument]]. It is a word often used in [[rhetoric]]. Rhetoric is the science of speaking well, and convincing other people of your [[idea]]s.

Translated to English, ''ad hominem'' means ''against the person''. In other words, when someone makes an ad hominem, they are [[attack]]ing the person they are arguing against, instead of what they are saying.

The term comes from the Latin word ''homo'', which means [[human]]. ''Hominem'' is a [[gender]] neutral version of the word ''homo''. In ancient [[Rome]] it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings.

Ad hominem can be a way to use [[reputation]], [[rumor]]s and [[hearsay]] to change the minds of other people listening. When a [[social network]] has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a negative [[label]] to them, this can work more often.

It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument. In [[court]]s and in [[diplomacy]] ad hominems are not appreciated.

Ad hominems are not wrong every time. For example, when people think that someone can't be [[Trust (social sciences)|trusted]], things that they have said previously can be [[doubt]]ed.

== What an ad hominem argument looks like ==
In [[logic]], a [[wikt:proof|proof]] is something that starts with [[premise]]s, and goes through a few logical [[argument]]s, to reach a [[conclusion]].

=== Normal (valid) proof ===
# All [[human]]s are mortal
# [[Socrates]] is a man (he is human)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

=== Ad hominem example ===
# Person A thinks [[abortion]] should be [[illegal]]
# Person A is uneducated and poor
# Therefore, abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

'''Native Americans''' (also called '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''', or '''Indigenous Peoples of America''') are the people, and their descendants, who were in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]] Islands when Europeans arrived. There are many different [[tribe]]s of Native American people, with many different languages. There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined. Approximately 51 million Native Americans live in [[Latin America]].

Sometimes these people are called &quot;Indians&quot;, but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from [[India]]. When [[Christopher Columbus]] was travelling [[West]], he did not know about the [[Americas]]. He thought he was going to [[West Indies]], so he called the people &quot;Indians&quot;. 

Many Native Americans died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from [[disease]]s that came with the Europeans that were new to the Native Americans, in [[battle]] with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as [[slave]]s. Most of the native people were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands.

The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from [[Asia]]. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when [[Alaska]] was connected to [[Siberia]] by the [[Bering land bridge]].

Some Native American tribes of North America are [[Cherokee]], [[Maya people|Maya]] or [[Yucatec]], [[Aztecs]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and [[Sioux]]. 

Some Native American tribes of South America are [[Aymara people|Aymara]], [[Guaraní people|Guarani]], [[Quechua]], and [[Tupi]].
